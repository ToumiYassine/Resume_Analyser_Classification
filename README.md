Welcome to the **Resume Analyser Classification** project! This project aims to analyze and classify resumes using machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.8 or higher recommended)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeJaM35/Resume_Analyser_Classification.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd Resume_Analyser_Classification
   ```

3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
